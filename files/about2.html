        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I wanted to take Web Programming and Engineering because I felt like
            it was very relevant and I also needed to refresh on my web programming 
            abilities.  Before applying for Tufts, I used the Odin Project to learn
            how to do web development.  I have some experience with Linux, html, css,
            and javascript.  However, once I started attending Tufts, I completely stopped
            using it so I need to relearn a lot of things again.

        <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
        <a href = "https://www.bcdtofuhouse.com/"></a>
        <p>This is one of my favorite restaurants because I love Soon Tofu Soup.  They offer a variety of
            options for the soup and the soups get plenty spicy which I enjoy.

            <div class="soup"></div>
            <div class="soupText">This dish is usually prepared in a hot stone pot.  
                Before eating it, an egg is cracked inside and cooked in the hot soup.
                It is enjoyed with a bowl of rice on the side and other assorted banchan.
