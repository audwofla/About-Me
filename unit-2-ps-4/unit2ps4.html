        <p>The API I selected randomly generates a human profile and its information.</p>
        <a href="https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/">Here is the link to where I found the API</a>
        <p>This API didn't require any options/parameters.</p>
        <p>I can see this API being useful for creating people to test a database.  I can also see it being used to help create bot accounts.</p>
